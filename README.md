# NpavChavQuav-Poop-Card

This is a card game I played with my siblings when I was growing up. You play with a 52-deck of cards, and choose 1 random card. That is the poop card (Npav Chav Quav in Hmong). This means that there is one card in the deck that is missing a pair, meaning whoever has that pair is the loser. You deal the rest of the deck based on the number of players, and you remove any pair you have. For example, you have 8 cards, and there are a pair of 10s and Queens. You take them out of the game and you will be left with cards that don't match. Once all players have done this, left to the dealer goes first, and they choose 1 card from one person of their choice. If you get a pair, you take it out of the game and keep going until there are no more pairs left. If a person has no more cards, they are out of the game. You keep going till one person remains.

There is only one loser, and have fun!

------------------------------------

This Python version I made is against a CPU and is 1v1. I plan to potentially add a 2nd bot or 3rd bot to make it more fun. I hope you enjoy.

# FUTURE PLANS FOR THIS PROJECT

- Add a 2nd bot, or the option to add mulitple and deal cards accordingly.
- use matplotlib to add graphics to the game.
